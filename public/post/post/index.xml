      <description>I have always wanted to build attractive websites and still have a lot of control on the various facets of the website. I had previously owned a Google Site, which I never liked. I am not a professional with regards to web-development. Besides, my needs were minimal. With little knowledge on this topic, I did what everyone else does – dive straight into it.

      <description>Hello all!
This is my first post on my new website/blog, thus the title Om Vighnaraja (instead of a Hello World). My hope is to keep y’all updated with content regularly.
Thank you.</description>
