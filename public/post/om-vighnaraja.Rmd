Hello all!

This is my first post on my new website/blog, thus the title *Om Vighnaraja* (instead of a *Hello World*). My hope is to keep y'all updated with content regularly. 

One of my favorite things about RMD files is that it compiles math so beautifully. For example, 

Fix $d, w \in [0, 1]$. The indifferent agent $\hat{\theta} \in [0, 1]$ can be obtained by the following equation:
$$w\Bigg(\frac{d}{F(\hat{\theta})}\Bigg) - \hat{\theta} = 0.$$
Further, $\hat{\theta}$ is unique. 

Thank you.
