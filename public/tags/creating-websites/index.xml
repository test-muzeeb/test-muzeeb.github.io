      <description>Update: Much of this information is available in detail at multiple places, including:
The Little Dataset,Official Blogdown E-Book,Alison Hill (who is a co-author on the textbook),among others.
I had previously owned a Google Site, which I never liked. I am quite comfortable with R, and when Yihui Xie and co-authors came out with the book on blogdown, I decided to try it. However, it can be still quite difficult with no experience to HTML, or prior exposure to CSS.</description>
