      <description>I am writing this post as I complete my first quarter of teaching as an Assistant Professor. I taught the core Operations and Supply Chain Management to FT MBAs.1
As I went through this process for the first time, I realized that I needed templates for various files (e.g., syllabus, exams, homework assignments, case writeups, instruction slides, etc.). While there was an abundance of such resources online, it is hard for a single user to try out everything to weed out the bad ones from the good ones.</description>

      <title>Some Information on Creating Websites with R</title>

      <description>Update: Much of this information is available in detail at multiple places, including:
The Little Dataset,Official Blogdown E-Book,Alison Hill (who is a co-author on the textbook),among others.
I had previously owned a Google Site, which I never liked. I am quite comfortable with R, and when Yihui Xie and co-authors came out with the book on blogdown, I decided to try it. However, it can be still quite difficult with no experience to HTML, or prior exposure to CSS.</description>

      <description>Hello all!
This is my first post on my new website/blog, thus the title Om Vighnaraja (instead of a Hello World). My hope is to keep yâ€™all updated with content regularly.
One of my favorite things about RMD files is that it compiles math so beautifully. For example,
Fix \(d, w \in [0, 1]\). The indifferent agent \(\hat{\theta} \in [0, 1]\) can be obtained by the following equation:\[w\Bigg(\frac{d}{F(\hat{\theta})}\Bigg) - \hat{\theta} = 0.</description>

      <description>Interests My broad interests are in incentive and information design in platforms/marketplaces &amp;ndash; environments where a large number of agents interact.
I am also interested in analyzing problems in retail (also motivated by my experience at Nordstrom).
