<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>This is my first post on my new website/blog, thus the title <em>Om Vighnaraja</em> (instead of a <em>Hello World</em>). My hope is to keep yâ€™all updated with content regularly.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about RMD files is that it compiles math so beautifully. For example,</p>
<p>Fix <span class="math inline">\(d, w \in [0, 1]\)</span>. The indifferent agent <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta} \in [0, 1]\)</span> can be obtained by the following equation:
<span class="math display">\[w\Bigg(\frac{d}{F(\hat{\theta})}\Bigg) - \hat{\theta} = 0.\]</span>
Further, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\theta}\)</span> is unique.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
