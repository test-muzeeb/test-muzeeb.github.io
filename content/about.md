I am a second year PhD student in the Marketing Department at the [Mays Business School](https://mays.tamu.edu/) at Texas A&M University. 

My broad research interests are in the area of Emprical Marketing Strategy. Specifically, I am interested in bussines-to-bussiness (B2B) markets.

I am co-advised by [Hari Sridhar](https://mays.tamu.edu/directory/shriharisridhar/) (Texas A&M University) and [Vikas Mittal](https://business.rice.edu/person/vikas-mittal) (Rice University).

My full [CV](/files/Muzeeb_Shaik_CV.pdf) is available here.
